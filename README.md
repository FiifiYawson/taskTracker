# tasktracker
this is a react project code that tracks your tasks.
you are allowed to create tasks and leave them on the page for later referencing.
a task could be anything at all a phone number, todo list, what ever it may be.
you are allowed to come back to the page and delete any task at will.

this website was created by myself for my first MERN STACK project.
it's great for beginner's who just leaned the MERN stack.
Feel free to copy my source code and I'm open to any idea you might have to update the app.

you can visit http://task-tracker-0.herokuapp.com to try it out
